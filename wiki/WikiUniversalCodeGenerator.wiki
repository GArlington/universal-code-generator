#summary Universal Quick Start

== How do I start using Universal to generate code? ==
To use universal you must be behind the CBE firewall (on a wired connection in Olin Hall). If you are not, then you can not access the code generation server running on morpheus.cbe.cornell.edu. To start the graphical user interface (GUI), open a terminal window and cd to UEditor-v1.0 directory. From the command line execute:

_./StartUniversal.sh_

If this command was successful you should see the translucent Universal splash screen popup.

== Nothing works and this software is crap. ==
Relax, Go eat cookie and calm down. This is alpha so expect some bugs. Please report specific GUI issues (exceptions, crashes or system hangs) or new feature requests to our issue page. Remember we can't fix JV's crappy programming if we don't know about issues.
